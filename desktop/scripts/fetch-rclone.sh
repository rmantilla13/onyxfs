# Build a PATCHED rclone and stage it as a Tauri sidecar.
#
# Why patched: rclone's macFUSE mount returns ENOSYS for setxattr, which macOS
# surfaces as EPERM. Finder writes extended attributes (Finder tags, quarantine,
# etc.) when copying a FOLDER, so the EPERM makes Finder abort the whole copy
# with "error code -8062". Our patch (scripts/rclone-xattr.patch) makes the
# cmount filesystem ACCEPT + DISCARD xattr writes (return success), so native
# Finder copy/paste of files AND folders works on a local (macFUSE) mount. The
# attributes aren't persisted on S3 — acceptable for a cloud drive.
#
# Build needs: Go, clang (Xcode CLT), and the FUSE headers. cgofuse compiles
# against fuse.h but dlopen()s libfuse at RUNTIME, so we only need the HEADERS at
# build time (vendored in scripts/macfuse-headers/, copied to the path cgofuse's
# CFLAGS hard-code). No macFUSE install / kernel extension required on the runner.
#
# Output: src-tauri/binaries/rclone-<target-triple>  (referenced by
# tauri.conf.json bundle.externalBin; Tauri ships it as Contents/MacOS/rclone)
